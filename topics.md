Specific topic areas where we would like to fund projects are compiled in the [Flashbots Research Problem Database](https://flashbots.notion.site/21f6b4a0d87680a2b08dca1eda93ff6f?v=21f6b4a0d87681ddb959000c44242e52) tagged as "Request for Community Research."

We are also happy to review submitted proposals for FRP support of projects on other topics to make empirical, theory, or implementation contributions to illumating MEV for Ethereum and L2 blockchains. 

You can gain a sense of our other current areas of focus by looking through the active FRP folder [here](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/tree/main/FRPs/active) or the Research section of the Flashbots Forum [here](https://collective.flashbots.net/c/research/20).
